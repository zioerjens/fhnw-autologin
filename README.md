## Security

The credentials are stored unencrypted in the chrome storage. This storage is not vulnerable to attacks over the browser. You have to keep in mind though, that malware or users having access to your operating system can access the password there. However, this is also the case with any other autofill applications. You best have a different password for your FHNW account to the ones you have in any other system.
